# AndriodAppProject
This is a simple Android app developed as our college project using XML for the frontend, and Java with Firebase for the backend. It connects customers with local vegetable vendors. Users can register, browse vegetables, add items to the cart, and manage their accounts. Vendors can list products, and admins handle approvals.
